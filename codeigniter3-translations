This project contains translations for the CodeIgniter system messages folder, system/language/english. A changelog has been added to the repository, so you can track updates between official releases.
Copy the folder(s) for the idioms you are interested in, from inside the language folder of this project to your application/language folder.

You may then use the CodeIgniter Language class to reference the translations directly, or you can set the default language in application/config/config to the idiom appropriate for your webapp.

There have been several questions about RTL languages, but that is not something addressed in CodeIgniter. The suggested approach is to keep any translations in left-to-right order, and to deal with right-to-left rendering through the "dir" attribute of an HTML element, or the "direction" attribute in CSS.

Repository Information
Each language is maintained by a community member, per the table below:

Contributing
If you have a translation or correction, please fork the repository, clone it locally, and then create a new branch (from develop) for each set of related changes or for a complete language pack. Once your branch is complete, then create a pull request to merge it into the main repository. Remember to "sign" your commits.

Pull requests to the repository will only be considered if they come from the maintainer for any translations in the request, or if the maintainer adds a comment indicating they approve of any changes. If a maintainer is unresponsive

PR conversations should be conducted in English, thanks.
